        <h2 class="section-heading">Understanding the market ..</h2>
        <p class="descriptions">
          At its core, a market is a place where many people come together and
          trade an asset with each other. The asset (e.g. a company's stocks, or
          a car) has some intrinsic value. Each market participant has a
          subjective perception of the value of the asset. Participants trade
          with each other based on their opinion of the value and the market
          price.

        <h2 class="section-heading">.. as a Complex System</h2>
        <p class="descriptions">
          The participants' subjective perception is what gives the market its
          efficiency (i.e. the ability to find a fair price), but also
          inefficiency at times. When a large group of people interact with each
          other, crowd behaviour emerges and market movements can become
          irrational for a while. A market is just like other complex systems,
          such as a flock of birds swarming.

        <h2 class="section-heading">Where Technical Analysis comes in</h2>
        <p class="descriptions">
          Technical Analysis is commonly used to measure market movements.
          Whilist it is not possible to predict the future, TA can tell you when
          a trend is weakening and the payout ratio becomes favourible. Whether
          the market moves in your direction after that is another story.

      <div class="section-container">
        <h2 class="section-heading">So does it work?</h2>
        <p class="descriptions">
          Well, that is the million dollar question (or billion). Like a horse
          betting pro, a professional trader needs to understand the strategy
          used like the back of the hand. What's the win rate? What's the
          average payout? How does the strategy fail in extreme cases? How do I
          feel when I'm in the red?

        <h2 class="section-heading">Finding your answers</h2>
        <p class="descriptions">
          These questions can only be answered by you, but Test-Ware trainer
          aims to help you find your answers through simulated trading with real
          market data. This is known as backtesting and is a quick way to get
          better at a strategy.

        <h2 class="section-heading">About the Trainer</h2>
        <p class="descriptions">
          The trainer includes a number of challenges. Each challenge contains
          the daily market price and volume data for a financial asset starting
          from a randomly chosen date after 2000. The name of the asset is not
          given to reduce bias, but a brief description of the asset is
          provided. Where applicable, the price is split and dividend-adjusted.
          And lastly, just like in real life, you may only attemp each challenge
          once!
